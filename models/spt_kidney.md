# model: spt_kidney
Autogenerated ODE System from SBML file with sbmlutils.
```
time: [min]
substance: [mmol]
extent: [mmol]
volume: [l]
area: [m^2]
length: [m]
```

## Parameters `p`
```
PEX_k = 1.0  # [1/min] 
Vext = 4.0  # [l] 
Vki = 1.5  # [l] 
Vurine = 1.0  # [l] 
```

## Initial conditions `x0`
```
P_ext = 0.0  # [mmol/l] Vext
P_urine = 0.0  # [mmol] Vurine
```

## ODE system
```
# y
PEX = PEX_k * Vki * P_ext  # [mmol/min]

# odes
d P_ext/dt = -PEX / Vext  # [mmol/l/min]
d P_urine/dt = PEX  # [mmol/min]
```
